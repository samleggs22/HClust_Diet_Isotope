Cranial shift of vertebrae with full sacralisation of first coccygeal vertebra and full lumbarisation of first sacral vertebra. Slight modification to C7 and T1 to account for this shift, with C7 acquiring a demi-facet and T1 exhibiting two demi-facets as opposed to the usual full facet and demi-facet. Spina bifida occulta in sacrum with the non-union of the sacral median crest. All the above-mentioned disorders are developmental/congenital in origin. Throughout the skeleton, there is bilateral and symmetrical deposition of woven bone, frequently, but not exclusively, adjacent to tendon and ligament attachment sites. Those attachments affected are: Clavicles- Costoclavicular ligament at the rhomboid pit fossa. Radius and ulna- Pronator quadratus and supinator Femora- pectineus, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis. Ossa coxae- gluteus minimus and gluteus medius Pronator quadratus of the ulnae are particularly remodelled with cortical bone and fibre bone to create a robust distal shaft. The bilateral and symmetrical nature of these lesions suggests that this is systemic. One possibility is hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy, although, this tends not to affect tendon and ligament attachments, it does predominantly affect the forearm. Non-metric traits: metopic suture, apical bone, ossicles in lambdoid, divided hypoglossal canal (right), mandibular torus (left and right) accessory transverse foramen in C5 and 6 (left only), acromial articular facet (left and right).",N,0,,W-E,Extended supine,Earth cut grave,0.2,-20.7,10,"Buckberry J, Montgomery J, Towers J, Müldner G, Holst M, Evans J, Gledhill A, Neale N, and Lee-Thorp J (2014).
